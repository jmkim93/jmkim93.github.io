I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with Prof. [Zongfu Yu](https://photonics.engr.wisc.edu). My research focuses on the simulation and inverse design of photonic systems for optical computing applications, including neuromorphic metasurfaces and photonic integrated circuits.

Before coming to the United States, I earned my Ph.D. from Seoul National University, South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. [Namkyoo Park](https://stargate.snu.ac.kr) and Prof. [Sunkyu Yu](https://waves.snu.ac.kr). During my doctoral work, I built a broad foundation in photonic systems, with particular experience in deep learning, disordered and time-varying photonics.

In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities such as running along the shoreline of Lake Mendota in Madison, as well as paddleboarding, camping, and hiking in nearby areas. I also enjoy road trips to explore nature and the wilderness, especially visits to national parks. [[Miscellaneous]](/miscel/)
